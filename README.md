Hey,

It was a pleasure and a challenge doing this assignment.

That was actually the first time I wrote a project, so I had to start from the beginning: download Viual Code and set everything up.

I used this video as a reference for my project (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqx_wzMmFeA&t=27375s), but I tried hard to think a do things my way.

There are some functions I took from the video, mainly because I felt stuck and could not think a way of doing it.

Other functions, I figure out myself, even though the video presented a "better" or cleaner way. I just didn't want to copy anything entirely from the video.

I also used a lot of w3school.com for quick reviews, while doing the project and It helped me a lot.

I think I achieved a good final result with this Blackjack game, and I'm happy with it.

Anyways, I hope you like the project!

Sincerely,
Pedro
